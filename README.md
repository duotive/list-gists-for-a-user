## Install

To install the project you have to simply run:

```
npm install
```

Once the instalation is done, create the .env file in the root project directory where you will have, the code below, where you should replace the TOKEN_CODE_HERE with your own personal token. A guide on how to creat the token can be found here: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

```
GIT_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN = 'TOKEN_CODE_HERE'
```
